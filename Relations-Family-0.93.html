<H1><A NAME="abstract">ABSTRACT</A></H1>
<P>This perl module uses perl5 objects to simplify searching through
and reporting on large, complex MySQL databases, especially those 
with foreign keys. It uses an object orientated interface, complete 
with functions to create and manipulate the relational family.</P>
<P>The current version of Relations::Family is available at</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://www.gaf3.com">http://www.gaf3.com</A></PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="what it does">WHAT IT DOES</A></H2>
<P>With Relations::Family you can create a 'family' of members for querying 
records. A member could be a table, or it could be a query on a table, like
all the different months from a table's date field. Once the members are
created, you can specify how those members are related, who's using who
as a foreign key lookup, and what values in members you might be interested 
in reporting on, like whether a customer has paid their bill.</P>
<P>Once the 'family' is complete, you can select records from one member, and
the query all the matching records from another member. For example, say you 
a product table being used as a lookup for a order items tables, and you want
to find all the order items for a certain product. You can select that 
product's record from the product member, and then view the order item 
records to find all the order items for that product.</P>
<P>You can also build a large query for report purposes using the selections 
from various members as well as values you might be interested in. For 
example, say you want to know which customer are paid up and how much 
business they've generated in the past. You can specify which members'
selections you want to use to narrow down the report and which values
you'd like in the report and then use the query returned to see who's
paid and for how much.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="calling relations::family routines">CALLING RELATIONS::FAMILY ROUTINES</A></H2>
<P>Most standard Relations::Family routines use both an ordered, named and
hashed argument calling style. (All except for <CODE>to_text())</CODE> This is because 
some routines have as many as eight arguments, and the code is easier to 
understand given a named or hashed argument style, but since some people, 
however, prefer the ordered argument style because its smaller, I'm glad 
to do that too.</P>
<P>If you use the ordered argument calling style, such as</P>
<PRE>
  $family-&gt;add_lineage('customer','cust_id','purchase','cust_id');</PRE>
<P>the order matters, and you should consult the function defintions 
later in this document to determine the order to use.</P>
<P>If you use the named argument calling style, such as</P>
<PRE>
  $famimly-&gt;add_lineage(-parent_name  =&gt; 'customer',
                        -parent_field =&gt; 'cust_id',
                        -child_name   =&gt; 'purchase',
                        -child_field  =&gt; 'cust_id');</PRE>
<P>the order does not matter, but the names, and minus signs preceeding them, do.
You should consult the function defintions later in this document to determine 
the names to use.</P>
<P>In the named arugment style, each argument name is preceded by a dash.  
Neither case nor order matters in the argument list.  -name, -Name, and 
-NAME are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to begin with 
a dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, Relations::Family assumes
dashes for the subsequent ones.</P>
<P>If you use the hashed argument calling style, such as</P>
<PRE>
  $famimly-&gt;add_lineage({parent_name  =&gt; 'customer',
                         parent_field =&gt; 'cust_id',
                         child_name   =&gt; 'purchase',
                         child_field  =&gt; 'cust_id'});</PRE>
<P>or</P>
<PRE>
  $famimly-&gt;add_lineage({-parent_name  =&gt; 'customer',
                         -parent_field =&gt; 'cust_id',
                         -child_name   =&gt; 'purchase',
                         -child_field  =&gt; 'cust_id'});</PRE>
<P>the order does not matter, but the names, and curly braces do, (minus signs are
optional). You should consult the function defintions later in this document to 
determine the names to use.</P>
<P>In the hashed arugment style, no dashes are needed, but they won't cause problems
if you put them in. Neither case nor order matters in the argument list. 
parent_name, Parent_Name, PARENT_NAME are all acceptable. If a hash is the first 
argument, Relations::Family assumes that is the only argument that matters, and 
ignores any other arguments after the {}'s.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="query arguments">QUERY ARGUMENTS</A></H2>
<P>Some of the Relations functions recognize an argument named query. This
argument can either be a hash or a Relations::Query object.</P>
<P>The following calls are all equivalent for $object-&gt;function($query).</P>
<PRE>
  $object-&gt;function({select =&gt; 'nothing',
                     from   =&gt; 'void'});</PRE>
<PRE>
  $object-&gt;function(Relations::Query-&gt;new(-select =&gt; 'nothing',

                      -alias    =&gt; $alias);</PRE>
<P>Creates and adds a member to a family. There's three basic groups of 
arguments in an add_member call. The first group sets how to name 
the member. The second sets how to configure the member. The third 
group explains how to create the query to display the member's records 
for selection.</P>
<P><STRONG>$name</STRONG> and <STRONG>$label</STRONG> - 
In the first group, $name and $label set the internal and external
identity, so both must be unique to the family. Typically, $name 
is a short string used for quickly specifying a member when coding
with a family, while $label is a longer string used to display the 
identity of a member to user using the program. $label can have 
spaces within it, $name cannot.</P>
<P><STRONG>$database</STRONG>, <STRONG>$table</STRONG>, <STRONG>$alias</STRONG> and <STRONG>$id_field</STRONG> - 
In the second group, $database, $table and $id_field set the MySQL
properties. The $database and $table variables are the database 
and table used by the member, while $id_field is the member's 
table's primary key field. Relations::Family uses this info when
connecting members to each other during a query.</P>
<P>Two or more members might use the same table in a database, or 
they might use the same table name in two different databases. 
Under either of these circumstances, if just the table name was 
used when building queries, MySQL would get confused. Enter 
$alias. This value is used to alias the table of the member. If
no alias is sent, this value is set to the table name of the
member.</P>
<P><STRONG>$query</STRONG> - 
This is the query used to populate a member's selection list. The
query must select two fields, 1) the id of the member, labeled 
'id', and 2) the label of the member, labeled 'label'. The id
field is what identifies one record from another in a way that is
understandable to the database. The id field is usually the primary 
key. The label field is used to distinguish one record from another 
in a way that is understandable to the user. If a Relations::Query
object is sent (see Query Arguments above), the object is cloned
so the orginal is not modified.</P>

<P>Sets the member's records selected by a user, as well as 
some other goodies to control the selection process.</P>
<P><STRONG>$name</STRONG> or <STRONG>$label</STRONG> - 
Specifies the member by name or label.</P>
<P><STRONG>$ids</STRONG> -
The ids selected. Can be a comma delimitted string, an array.</P>
<P><STRONG>$labels</STRONG> -
The labels selected. Can be a tab delimitted string, an
array, or a hash keyed by $ids. It is isn't necessary to 
send these, unless you want the selected labels returned 
by get_chosen.</P>
<P><STRONG>$selects</STRONG> -
An array of selected ids and labels. Each array member is a
string of the id and label value separated by a tab: ``$id\t$label''.
This when you used the ids_select and labels_select from 
<CODE>get_available()</CODE> to populate a &lt;SELECT&gt; list using the CGI module.</P>
<P><STRONG>$match</STRONG> -
Match any or all. Null or 0 for any, 1 for all. This deals with
multiple selections from a member and how that affects matching
records from another member. If a member is set to match any, 
calling <CODE>get_available()</CODE> for another member will return records 
from the second member that are connected to any of the 
first member's selections. If a member is set to match all, calling 
<CODE>get_available()</CODE> on another member will return records from the 
second member that are connected to all of the first member's
selections.</P>
<P><STRONG>$group</STRONG> -
Group include or exclude. Null or 0 for include, 1 for exclude. 
This deals with whether to return matching records or non 
matching records. If a member is set to group include, calling 
<CODE>get_available()</CODE> for another member will return records from the 
second member that are connected to the first member's selections. 
If a member is set to group exclude, calling <CODE>get_available()</CODE> on 
another member will return records from the second member that 
are not connected to the first member's selections.</P>
<P><STRONG>$filter</STRONG> -
Filter labels. In order to simplify the selection process, you 
can specify a filter to only show a select group of records 
from a member for selecting. The filter argument accepts a string,
$filter, and places it in the clause ``having label like 
'%$filter%'''.</P>
<P><STRONG>$limit</STRONG> -
Limit returned records. In order to simplify the selection 
process, you can specify a limit clause to only show a certain 
number of records from a member for selecting. The limit argument 
accepts a string, $limit, and places it in the clause ``limit 
$limit'', so it can be a single number, or two numbers separated
by a comma.</P>
<P><STRONG>$ignore</STRONG> -
Ignore or not. Null or 0 for don't ignore, 1 for ignore. If a 
member is set to don't ignore, calling <CODE>get_available()</CODE> for another 
member will return records from the second member that are related
in some way (depending on match and group) to the first member's 
selections.  If a member is set to ignore, calling <CODE>get_available()</CODE> 
on another member will return records from the second member while 
completely ignoring the first member's selections.</P>

The number of available records.</P>
<P><STRONG>$available-&gt;{ids_array}</STRONG> - 
An array reference of the ids of the available records.</P>
<P><STRONG>$available-&gt;{ids_select}</STRONG> - 
An array reference of ids and labels. Each array member is a 
record's id and label separated by a tab: ``$id\t$label''. This is
used to populate a &lt;SELECT&gt; list using the CGI module so that 
you can see both the ids and labels selected by a user.</P>

A hash reference of the labels of the available records, keyed 
by a record's id and label separated by a tab: ``$id\t$label''. This

<P>There's a type table for the different types of products, and a product table 
for the different products. There's also a one-to-many relationship between type 
to product, because each product is of a specific type.</P>
<P>A similar relationship exists between the sales_person table, which holds all 
the different sales people, and the region table, which holds the regions for
the sales peoples. Each sales person belongs to a particular region, so there's
a one-to-many relationship from the region table to the sales_person table.</P>
<P>If there's sellers, there's buyers. This is the function of the customer 
table. There is also an account table, for the accounts for each customer.
Since each customer has only one account, there is merely a one-to-one
relationship between customer and account.</P>
<P>With sellers and buyers, there must be purchases. Enter the purchase table,
which holds all the purchases. Since only one customer makes a certain 
purchase, but one customer could make many purchases, there is a one-to-many 
relationship from the customer table to the purchase table.</P>
<P>Each purchase contains some number of products at various quantities. This is 
the role of the item table. One purchase can have multiple items, so there is
a one-to-many relationship from the purchase table to the item table.</P>
<P>A product is the item purchased at different quantities, and a product can be
in multiple purchases. Thus, there is a one-to-many relationship from the 
product table to the item table.</P>
<P>Finally, zero or more sales people can get credit for a purchase, so there 
is many-to-many relationship between the sales_person and purchase tables.
This relationship is handled by the pur_sp table, so there is a one-to-many
relationship from the purchase table to the pur_sp table and a one-to-many 
relationship from the sales_person table to the pur_sp table.</P>

<P>Family's role in this is true to it's name sake: It brings all of this into
one place, and allows tables to connect to one another. A member in the finder 
family is created for each table in the finder database, and a lineage (for
one-to-many's) or a rivalry (for one-to-one's) for each relationship.</P>
<P>With Family, you can select records from one member and find all the 
connecting records in other members. For example, to see all the products
made by a purchase, you'd go to the purchase member, and select the purchase
in question, and then go to the product's member. The avaiable records
in product would be all the product on that purchase.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="usage">Usage</A></H2>
<P>To run the demo, make sure you've followed the setup instructions, and go
to the directory in which you've placed demo.pl and finder.pm. Run demo.pl
like a regular perl script.</P>
<P>The demo starts with a numbered listing of all the members of the finder 
family. To view available records from a member and/or make selections, type
in the member's number and hit return.</P>
<P>The first thing you'll be asked is if you want to choose available. This 
narrows down the current selected members of a list by the available 
records for a list. Enter 'Y' for yes, and 'N' for no. It defaults to 'N' so 
a blank is the same as no.</P>
<P>You'll then get two questions regarding the presentation of a member's 
records. I'll go into both here.</P>
<P>Limit is for displaying only a certain number of avaiable records at a time.
It's fed into a MySQL limit clause so it can be one number, or two separated
by a comma. To just see X number of rows from the begining, just enter X. To
see X number of rows starting at Y, enter Y,X.</P>
<P>Filter is for filtering available records for display. It takes a string, and
only returns member's available records that have the entered string in their
label. Just enter the text to filter by.</P>
<P>You'll then get a numbered listing of all the available records for that member, 
as well as the match, group, ignore, limit and filter settings for that member.</P>
<P>Next, you'll get some questions regarding which records are to be selectecd,
and how those selections are to be used (or not used!). I'll go into them here.</P>
<P>Selections are the records you want to choose. To choose records, type each 
number in, separating with commas.</P>
<P>Match is whether you want other lists to match any of your multiple selections 
from this member or all of them. 0 for many, 1 for all.</P>
<P>Group is whether you want to include what was selected in this member, or 
exclude was selected, in matching other member's records. 0 for include,
1 for exclude.</P>
<P>Finally, you'll be asked if you want to do this again. 'Y' for yes, 'N' for
no. It defaults to 'Y', so just type return for yes. If you choose yes, 
you'll get a list of members, go through the selection/viewing process again.</P>
<P>If you press 'N', demo.pl will ask if you want to create a reunion. A reunion
is like a final report query. It defaults to 'N', so just type return for no. 
If you choose no, the program will exit.</P>
<P>If you choose yes, you'll get a list of all the values in finder. At the Data
prompt, type in all values (by number) you'd like to see in the report query,
separating each with a comma. At the Group By prompt, type in all values (by 
number) you'd like to group by in the report query, separating each with a 
comma. At the Order By prompt, well, I bet you can figure it out.</P>
<P>After filling out the value information, a list of all members will be 
displayed. You'll be asked which members chosen values should be used in the 
query. Enter the numbers of the members to use for this.</P>
<P>After that's all set, you'll get the customized results of your report query.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="examples">Examples</A></H2>
<P>All together, this system can be used to figure out a bunch of stuff. Here's
some ways to query certain records. With each example, it's best to restart 
demo.pl for scratch (exit and rerun).</P>
<P><STRONG>Limit and Filter</STRONG> - 
There are 17 Sales Persons in the database. Though this isn't terribly many, 
you can lower the number sales people displayed at one time with Family two 
different ways, by limitting or by filtering. Here's examples for both.</P>
<P>First, let's look at all the sales people
- From the members list, select 7 for Sales Person.
- Don't choose available, no limit, and no filter. (or just hit return)
- There should be 17 available records:</P>

<H2><A NAME="relationsquery (perl)">Relations-Query (Perl)</A></H2>
<P>An object oriented form of a SQL select query. Takes hashes.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="relationsfamily (perl)">Relations-Family (Perl)</A></H2>
<P>Query engine for relational databases.  It queries members from
